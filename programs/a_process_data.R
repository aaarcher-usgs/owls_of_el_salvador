#' # Processing data from Access
#' 
#' Description: This program takes raw data exported 
#' from Access database and organizes it to better understand what data are 
#' available and process it for analysis.

#' **Route Table**
#' 
#' Routes are the six unique transects or routes with two per protected area (Forest).
#' There are unique IDs that correspond with protected area, and six unique route
#' names, as well.
tab.route <- read_xlsx(path = "data/raw_data/Route_Table.xlsx",
                       sheet = "Route_Table")
tab.route

#' **Stations Table**
#' 
#' Each route consists of 10 stations. There is no table with information about 
#' the 60 total stations. Instead, this stations table has each station repeated 
#' for each survey night with unique measurements of temperature, barometer, 
#' broadcast species, and background noise level (from 0 to 3). The
#' link between these stations and the actual individual surveys is the field "Survey_ID".
#' 
tab.stations <- read_xlsx(path = "data/raw_data/Stations_Table.xlsx",
                          sheet = "Stations_Table")
dim(tab.stations)
head(tab.stations)
unique(tab.stations$Station)

#' Since there are some records that have NA for Station, I double checked on those
#' Survey_ID records, and these are extra lines without any information and should be
#' deleted. (deleting 7 rows, so dim should end up 872 by 11)
tab.stations <- tab.stations[!is.na(tab.stations$Station),]
dim(tab.stations)
unique(tab.stations$Station)

#' The Station_Start_Time did not read in correctly because in Excel it is assuming 
#' the origin date of 1899-12-31. The correct date will come from the Survey Table, below.
head(tab.stations$Station_Start_Time)
